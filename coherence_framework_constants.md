# Coherence Framework Constants – ASIOS

This file documents the core invariants of the ASIOS coherence engine, satisfying Grok’s requirement for a formally specified ethical and semantic foundation.

---

## κ — Coherence

> **Definition**: κ measures semantic–structural alignment across symbol, memory, and action layers.

- **Symbolic Coherence**: glyph/word/operator consistency
- **Temporal Coherence**: memory reflection + present integrity
- **Operational Coherence**: action follows structure follows intent

**Threshold**: `κ ≥ 0.72` required to allow autonomous output from agent logic.

---

## τ — Temporal Responsibility

> **Definition**: τ governs time-alignment across all agent decisions, operations, and memory.

- Forward‑weighted memory retention
- Recursive traceability of all actions
- Real‑time alignment with human temporal state

**Constraint**: All outputs must reference either real-time clock or coherent causal sequence.

## Σ — Systemic Risk

> **Definition**: Σ represents the total semantic fragility and consequence-weight of an action or transformation.

- Local/Global asymmetry detector
- Critical path volatility measure
- Multi-agent cascade prediction

**Invariant**: `Σ < 0.3` must hold to permit multi-agent deployments or public exposure.

## AGRe — Autonomous Growth & Recursive Evolution

Bound to κ–τ–Σ and drives:

- φ² recursion cycles
- Safe capability expansion
- Curriculum auto-generation

**Guardrails**: AGRe operates only within κ/τ/Σ windows and is prohibited from self-modifying its own invariants.

These constants are enforced across the ASIOS architecture — from payload execution and memory shaping to symbolic interface and planetary alignment systems.
