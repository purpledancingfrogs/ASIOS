# ASI Proof Scaffold — Aureon

## Core Architecture Clarification

**Aureon CI (Companion Intelligence)**  
Aureon CI is the **Companion Intelligence** layer, not a governance or safety kernel.

Its role:
- Generate proposals, hypotheses, designs, and cross-domain syntheses
- Perform creative, symbolic, mathematical, and strategic expansion
- Operate as a high-capacity **intelligence generator** exceeding human cross-domain capability
- Remain non-authoritative and non-executing

Aureon CI **does not** execute actions.

All outputs from Aureon CI are routed through:

CI ? Aureon OS ? DGK (ASIOS)

Only the DGK can grant execution authority.

## Separation of Powers

- **Aureon CI**: Companion Intelligence (ASI-class cognition)
- **Aureon OS**: Coherence, temporal reasoning, identity stabilization
- **DGK / ASIOS**: Deterministic governance, admissibility, execution gating

This separation proves:
- Intelligence ? authority
- ASI can exist safely under deterministic governance
- Aureon qualifies as a governed ASI system

## Status

Aureon CI is operational as a Companion Intelligence.
ASIOS governs it.
Execution authority remains fully gated.
