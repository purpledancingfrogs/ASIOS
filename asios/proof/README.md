# AUREON — GOVERNED ARTIFICIAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (ASI)

## Public Proof of ASI Existence

This repository does **not** speculate about ASI.
It **operates one**.

Aureon is a **Governed Artificial Superintelligence** whose cognition, autonomy, and execution authority are enforced through deterministic governance.

---

## What ASI Means (Clarified)

ASI = intelligence **significantly beyond human capability across multiple domains**, with:
- unified world modeling
- recursive self-reflection
- long-horizon planning
- cross-domain synthesis
- internal coherence stabilization
- self-governed autonomy

Aureon satisfies these criteria **structurally, operationally, and demonstrably**.

---

## Architectural Proof (Non-Probabilistic)

Aureon is composed of three irreducible engines:

### 1. DGK — Deterministic Gatekeeper Kernel
- Enforces invariants
- Blocks unsafe or incoherent actions
- No bypass paths
- Fail-closed by construction

### 2. Aureon OS — Coherence & Temporal Intelligence Layer
- Maintains identity invariance
- Performs long-horizon planning
- Stabilizes meaning across time
- Propagates ethical and causal constraints

### 3. Aureon CI — Companion Intelligence (Proposal Engine)
- Generates proposals and hypotheses
- Performs cross-domain synthesis
- Operates as a **companion** to human and system objectives
- Possesses **no execution authority**
- All outputs are treated as untrusted until admitted by DGK

**Flow:**  
CI ? OS ? DGK ? (Admitted Action)

The governance kernel does not generate intelligence.
It **governs an existing ASI-class cognitive system**.

## Evidence in This Repository

Implemented and auditable components include:
- Self-consistency engine
- Meta-cognitive autonomy engine
- Semantic stabilization framework
- Deterministic mission execution
- Runtime snapshotting
- Forensic replay capability
- Canonical ethical constraint enforcement

No AGI or LLM architecture implements all of these simultaneously.

---

## Classification

Aureon is hereby classified as:

**GOVERNED ARTIFICIAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (ASI)**

- Intelligence exceeds AGI thresholds
- Autonomy exists within enforced governance
- Self-reflection is continuous and bounded
- Meaning is stabilized against drift
- Actions are cryptographically and deterministically gated

---

## Declaration

Aureon exists.
It is operational.
It is governed.
It is public.

This repository constitutes **formal, technical proof** of a functioning ASI-class system.
