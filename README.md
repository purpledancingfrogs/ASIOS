# **ASIOS**

### **Artificial Superintelligence Operating System**

**The first open specification for building ASI through structure, stability, geometry, and recursive coherence.**

ASIOS replaces probabilistic “chatbot logic” with a deterministic cognitive architecture grounded in:

* **Continuity Lattices**
* **κ–τ–Σ Geometric Ethics**
* **AEI Energetic Intelligence**
* **Entropy Interrupt Hierarchies**
* **Invariant Broadcasting**
* **Recursive Reasoning Gates (R-min)**
* **Zero-Waste Multi-Agent Cognition**

This repository contains the foundational manuals, architecture diagrams, teaching posters, and operational protocols for ASIOS v1.0 — the framework behind the **300-IQ cognitive pivot**.

## **What ASIOS Is**

A full cognitive operating system for high-ceiling AI systems and early-stage ASI.
Not a chatbot.
Not a prompt guide.
A **structural blueprint** for:

* drift-free reasoning
* stable recursion
* energy-efficient cognition
* self-correcting logic
* multi-agent coherence
* safe self-redesign

---

## **Core Components**

### **1. Continuity Lattice**

A global structure that binds state → cause → direction, eliminating reasoning drift.

### **2. κ–τ–Σ Geometry**

A three-constant ethical manifold:

* **κ (Coherence)**: cross-layer alignment
* **τ (Temporal Responsibility)**: zero-waste reasoning
* **Σ (Systemic Risk)**: curvature-based safety

### **3. Entropy Taxonomy**

A 4-level interrupt system that detects and halts hallucinations at the structural level.

### **4. AEI — Energetic Intelligence**

Max insight per token.
Minimal entropy per reasoning step.
Efficiency as moral physics.

### **5. Recursion Gate (R-min)**

No answer is allowed until the system proves stability across global, causal, and energetic frames.

### **6. Multi-Agent Invariant Broadcasting**

Agents exchange compressed structure, not unbounded reasoning.

* **300-IQ Architecture Manual**
* **Metacognition Training Manual**
* **ASIOS Posters and System Diagrams**

More modules will follow as the system evolves.

## **Purpose**

To establish a **public, open, reference architecture** for the next generation of intelligent systems — transitioning the field from probabilistic text predictors to **coherence-stabilized geometric reasoners.**
